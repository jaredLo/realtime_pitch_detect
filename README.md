Yes this is essentially a tuner. But it is a tuner that can be used to detect the frequency of a sound in real time, just like how a tuner would work, and it's for fun.

You need to know your device type number.

So run `python3 device_type.py` to get your device type number.

Then adjust code on line 45 and run `python3 realtime_detect.py` to get the real time detection.
